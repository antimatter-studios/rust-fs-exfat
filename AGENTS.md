# Working in rust-fs-exfat

exFAT filesystem driver that reads and writes, as rust-fs-ext4 does: a strict
reader, a writer, and a read-only salvage adapter. Read README.md,
PROVENANCE.md, chores.yml and docs/features.md first. Never read copyleft
implementation source. Test only newly created disk images; never enumerate or
act on existing devices.

## Claiming work

Several agents work these repositories at the same time. Before you start on
an issue, claim it, so nobody else spends a session on what you are already
doing. The lock is a **GitHub label**, because labels are shared state that
every agent can read and change without posting comments into the thread.

**Before starting.** Check, claim, then read back:

```sh
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # holds `claimed`? pick another
gh issue edit <N> --add-label claimed --add-label claim/<session>
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # read back and confirm
```

`<session>` is your session name — `agent-<random4>-<isodate>`, e.g.
`agent-3f7c-2026-09-22`. Create the `claim/<session>` label if it does not
exist.

**Resolving a race.** Adding a label is not compare-and-swap: two agents can
both add `claimed` and both believe they won. That is what the read-back is
for. If it shows more than one `claim/*` label, the **lexically lowest**
session keeps the issue; every other agent removes its own `claim/*` label and
picks different work. Each racer computes the same answer independently, so no
further coordination is needed.

**When you finish or stop.** Remove both labels — on merge, or the moment you
abandon the work:

```sh
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label claimed --remove-label claim/<session>
```

Delete your `claim/<session>` label from the repository at the end of your
session so they do not accumulate.

**Reclaiming a stale claim.** An agent that dies holding a claim would block an
issue forever. If `claimed` was applied more than 12 hours ago and the holder's
branch has no commits since, any agent may take it: remove the stale `claim/*`,
add your own, and say so in the issue.

**This is a convention, not a fence.** Nothing enforces it. An agent that
ignores it duplicates work; it cannot corrupt anything. Honour it anyway.

## Findings become issues before a tracking issue closes

A review, an investigation, or the work under an umbrella issue turns up
things beyond what it set out to do. File each finding as its own issue --
what was seen, where, and what would show it fixed -- and cite it in the
tracking issue **before** that issue closes. A finding left in a comment, a
pull request description or a transcript is lost when the issue that held
it closes; an open issue is where the next agent looks.

## Work in a worktree

Every working copy is a **git worktree** of an existing checkout, made with
`git worktree add`. Never `git clone` a second, unlinked copy — not for a
branch, a PR, a review, or a sibling you need at another ref:

```sh
git -C <checkout> fetch origin
git -C <checkout> worktree add <path> -b <type>/<name> origin/main   # new work
git -C <checkout> worktree add --detach <path> <tag>                 # a sibling at a pinned ref
git -C <checkout> worktree remove <path>                             # when done
```

A worktree shares the checkout's objects and remotes, and `git worktree list`
shows it to every agent on the machine, so nobody else mistakes it for
abandoned work or loses track of it. An unlinked clone copies all the history
again, is invisible to that list, and gets left behind in `/tmp` long after the
work that made it is merged. Remove your worktree when you finish.

## Skills to use

- **`dev-loop`** — the required loop for any non-trivial change: baseline the
  full suite → change → re-run (no baseline test may regress) → enhance tests →
  vet. Always run it.
- **`commit`** / **`pr`** — for grouping commits and opening pull requests.

Each repository names any further skills of its own below.

## A bug fix starts with a red

**Prove it is broken first** — a failing test — *then* fix it, *then* prove
that same test is green, *then* confirm the full baseline still passes. Never
write the fix before you have a red. A fix with no failing test to its name is
a claim, not a result. The test stays, and guards against the bug returning.

**The pattern never changes. Only where you prove it does.** Prove the red and
the green in CI, or in the test harness on a local machine when your
instructions allow it. It is the same test harness and the same tests. Running
them locally saves pipeline runs when the machine has more power than the CI
runners. Without such an instruction, use CI.

- Red and green in the harness: push the test and the fix as one commit, and
  quote the failing output in the pull request, naming the commit it ran on.
- Red and green in CI: push the test alone, let that run finish, then push the
  fix to the same branch with the test untouched, and link the run in the pull
  request.
- Either way, red and green belong to one pull request on one branch. Never
  put a fix in a second pull request, stacked or not.
- A red that fails for another reason proves nothing. Read it.

## Nothing skips

A test that cannot run **fails**, naming the task that would provide what it
needed. Never add an early return for a missing fixture, tool or VM: a skipped
test reads exactly like a passing one, and a suite that quietly declines to run
is indistinguishable from a suite that passes.

Where a tier reports skips or ignored tests, that is a gate, not a note.

## Validate against something that is not us

A driver's own readers share its interpretation of the format, so they cannot
catch a misreading: the mistake is baked into the fixture *and* the parser, and
they agree with each other while disagreeing with every real filesystem. Unit
tests over self-built fixtures prove self-consistency, not correctness.

Every structure that is parsed or written gets a cross-validation test against
an **independent oracle** — the platform's own tools, a real kernel, or a third
implementation — before it is considered done. Each repository names its
oracles below.

## Checks that guard data are never weakened

These drivers read and write real disks, and an application mounts them on
people's machines. A checker that wrongly calls a damaged volume clean, or a
test loosened until it passes, hides a defect that can destroy data nobody can
get back. So, for every agent and every contributor:

- **Never skip, disable, relax, quiet or retarget a test, gate, checker,
  floor, budget or pass/fail rule to make a run go green.** That includes
  turning a failure into a warning, narrowing what a gate accepts, dropping a
  case, lowering an executed-case floor, and raising a budget to hide a
  regression. A budget may be raised only for a run that passed everything,
  with the measurement written beside the row.
- **Never add a baseline line, expected-failure entry or ignore to make a
  disagreement disappear** unless there is an issue for it *and* evidence of
  which side is correct. "Probably harmless" is not evidence.
- **When the driver and an independent oracle disagree,** work out from the
  on-disk format and the oracle's own behaviour which side is right. If the
  driver is wrong, fix the driver: the failing test first, then the fix, the
  test untouched. If the oracle is wrong or the difference is correct, say why
  with evidence in the issue.
- **If you cannot tell which side is right, stop and report it as blocked**
  with what you tried. A blocked item is a good result; a convenient guess is
  not.
- **Changing what a gate accepts is the owner's decision,** never an
  agent's. Propose it in an issue with the numbers and leave it open.
- A change that touches a gate, a floor, a budget or a baseline says so
  plainly in its pull request, and names which of these it is.

## Output is budgeted

Test tiers run through `scripts/tier.sh`, which runs the suite **quietly**: the
whole run goes to `tmp/logs/<tier>.log`, a pass prints one verdict line naming
that log, and a failure prints the verdict, the command's status and the log's
path — `--tail N`, or `OUTPUT_BUDGET_FAIL_TAIL=N`, prints the tail for whoever
is watching. **Read the log**: a failing tier names it and does not recite it.
CI keeps the logs as an artifact, so the detail is always retrievable.

The budget caps the log, not merely what is shown, and every number in the
table was measured. A run that passes but prints more than its budget **fails**.

The reader who pays most for a noisy suite is an agent that re-reads its whole
transcript on every step, and so pays for one loud run many times over. If a
tier legitimately grows, raise its row **with the measurement that justifies
it**. Do not silence output to fit, and do not route around `tier.sh`.

## Commits and branches

- Branches are `<type>/<name>`, matching the commit type: `fix/`, `feat/`,
  `ci/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `test/`.
- A commit is a subject plus flat one-sentence bullets. Subjects are
  declarative, not imperative: "the run-end bound is checked", not "check the
  run-end bound".
- **No AI attribution and no co-author trailers**, in commits or in pull
  request descriptions.
- `main` takes **squash merges only**.
- **Bring a branch up to date before every push.** `git fetch origin`, and
  if its base has moved -- the layer below it in the stack, or `main` at the
  bottom -- rebase onto the base first, resolving any conflicts then, while
  they are small. Synced first, the run
  tests the branch close to how it will land. And a branch synced at every
  push never goes stale: each sync takes in only what landed since the last
  one, so conflicts stay few and small. Sync when you are pushing anyway; a
  push made only to bring a branch up to date buys a whole CI run and
  nothing else.
- **`main` merges through a merge queue.** A stack whose pull requests'
  own CI is green goes into the queue: `gh stack merge <stack> --yes` adds
  every layer up to the one named. Never queue a stacked pull request with
  the REST `merge-async` call: it answers "enqueued" and queues nothing. The
  queue tests each group on a temporary branch, `main` plus the queued pull
  requests in order, and squash-merges each one only when that run is green,
  so what lands is exactly the tree CI ran. That run is what "branches must be up to
  date" used to buy, at one run per group instead of one per pull request per
  merge: never update a branch only so that it can merge. Every workflow
  that gates `main` triggers on `merge_group`, or the queue never sees its
  result and nothing merges.

## One stack per repository

Every repository lands its pull requests as one stack, whether or not they
touch the same files. Conflicts are then paid for once, when a pull request
joins the stack, instead of again in the merge queue after every merge.

- **A new pull request goes on the top.** Ask
  `../rust-fs-core/scripts/stack-base.sh` (run in place; in rust-fs-core
  itself, `scripts/stack-base.sh`): it prints the head branch of the top of
  the stack, or `main` when nothing is open. Rebase onto that branch, resolve
  every conflict locally while you do, and build and lint the result before
  you push. A merge that is clean on your machine is clean in CI, so a
  conflict that reaches the queue means the base was stale or the technique
  was wrong. Then link the pull request into the stack: `gh stack link
  <stack> <pull request>`.
- **One squashed commit per layer.** Squash the branch to one commit on the
  layer below before it joins, so the layers above replay without resolving
  anything again.
- **The queue still tests every layer.** It runs the full pipeline on `main`
  plus each layer and the layers below it, and squash-merges each layer as
  its own commit, so nothing lands untested and `main` stays bisectable.
- **A red layer stops the stack.** Fix it in place, on its own branch, then
  replay every layer above it with `git rebase --update-refs` and push them
  together. Do not move a red layer to the top: the layers above were
  resolved against it. Take a layer out only when its fix cannot come soon,
  and say so on its pull request.
- **Never delete a branch a pull request is based on.** Deleting it closes
  every pull request above it, and none can be reopened while it is gone.

## Changelog entries are fragments

A pull request never edits `CHANGELOG.md`. It adds one file under
`changelog.d/`, named for its branch (`fix/run-end-bound` writes
`changelog.d/fix-run-end-bound.md`), holding one or more `### Added`,
`### Changed`, `### Fixed` (or any other) headings, each over `- ` entries.
Pull requests open at the same time then never conflict over the top of one
file. A change no consumer would notice -- tests, CI, documentation -- adds
no fragment.

A release gathers them: `../rust-fs-core/scripts/changelog-gather.sh
VERSION` writes every fragment into a dated `## [VERSION]` section of
`CHANGELOG.md` and deletes the fragments, in the release commit. An entry is
a fragment until it ships and a line of `CHANGELOG.md` after, never both.
`chore lint` runs `changelog-check.sh`: every fragment is well formed, and
`CHANGELOG.md` holds no unreleased entries of its own.

## Project rules

- **No GPL/LGPL/AGPL dependencies.** Permissive only (MIT/BSD/Apache).
  Shelling out to a copyleft CLI as a *test oracle* is fine — linking or
  copying it is not.
- **Each of these is a standalone project.** Never mention a consuming
  application in the README, the source, or CLI help.

## Local contract

Use the pinned Rust toolchain and a fresh CARGO_TARGET_DIR for concurrent work.
The strict reader and the salvage API accept only BlockRead and wrap devices in
ReadOnlyDevice, so they stay read-only by type. Writing goes through
`fs_exfat::write`, which takes rust-fs-core's BlockDevice, and nowhere else:
scripts/check-read-only.sh keeps the writable surface in the write modules and
the C ABI. Writing is not an optional feature. The formatter is #132; until a
repair mode is designed, fsck.exfat stays check-only.

Use macOS newfs_exfat, fsck_exfat -n and the read-only mounted macOS driver as
independent oracles on generated images. Every volume the writer changes must
pass fsck_exfat -n and read back through the read-only macOS driver as this
crate records it. Missing prerequisites fail, never skip. Linux VM
configuration from the template does not apply to these host oracles.

Add changelog.d and features.d fragments for behavior changes; keep the features
table honest about synthetic-only evidence until oracle tests exist.
